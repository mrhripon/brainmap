            <div class="para two-column">
                <p>The I-brainmap™ or integrated brain map was developed by psychologist Rita McInnes. It is a model for
                    understanding how the brain gets Stuck on Stress (SoS brain) through overwhelming or traumatic
                    events. It explains how overwhelming events are stored in the body for years and when triggered, can
                    drop you into the felt experience as if it’s happening right now. What makes (grey) matters worse is
                    that you often remain unaware that the current experience is tied to something that may have
                    happened decades ago, because the parts of the brain that orient you to time and place have
                    disconnected. In short your brain doesn’t have a map or a compass during these events of
                    re-experiencing. The I-brainmap™ is a bottom-up-inside-out model. It starts at the bottom by firstly
                    describing the
                    common ways brain overwhelm is experienced, from the inside. Next it explains, using relevant
                    brain-science, how and why the brain functions in this way. The I-brainmap™ then outlines how to
                    change the (SoS) brain using mindfulness-based techniques that you can use when you experience lower
                    brain activation.</p>

                    <div class="para">
                        <p>Our big brain is exquisitely useful in the classroom or managing complex maths equations, but
                            it doesn’t know much about emotional or lower brain (grey) matters. The i-brainmap™ maps the
                            experience of the brain-body-mind dynamic of distress and the process of integration. It
                            assumes the brain can change itself. The challenge is showing the brain how to do that and
                            what inhibits it. Often the greatest challenge is our intellect and cognitive function – our
                            big brain.</p>
                        <p>The I-brainmap explains all this to the brain and how to work from bottom up at the time the
                            distress is happening. Until we engage the whole brain we are working from fragmented maps
                            and stories and the brain is unable to make the required connections for integration to
                            occur.</p>

                        <p>The I-brainmap™ was developed over more than seven years in clinical practice. <br>
                            In the beginning, as I explained to people what I knew about how the brain behaves and why
                            it gets stuck on stress or overwhelming experiences of the past, I was preparing clients for
                            therapy. But I found as I explained what was happening in the brain people reported change
                            before we began “treatment.”</p>

                        <p>Meet your brain as you’ve never encountered it before.</p>
                        <p>In this lively and imaginative book, psychologist Rita McInnes invites your curious brain to
                            join her and other characters in dialogue to uncover the experience of brain change in the
                            everyday.</p>
                        <p>i-brainmap takes you on a journey of discovery into practical brain change, starting with a
                            field map of experience on how the brain gets Stuck on Stress (SoS brain) and what you can
                            do to free your brain.</p>

                        <p>If you’ve ever tried to kick a habit, felt stuck in the same old round-and-round conversation
                            in your head, watched on in horror as you threw a tantrum in the boss’s office or at the
                            traffic lights, or experienced any other kind of ‘stuck’, I-brainmap can show you the simple
                            secrets of practical brain change.</p>
                        <p>I-brainmap combines insights, discovered from intimately tracking brain integration in
                            hundreds of clients, with brain science. The techniques used in I-brainmap are grounded in
                            the principles of mindfulness to create a practical, bottom-up approach to brain change.</p>
